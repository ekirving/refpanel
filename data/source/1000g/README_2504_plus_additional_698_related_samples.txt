As described in the READMEs in these directories, NYGC released 30x coverage seqeunce data on the 2504 samples in the 1000 Genomes Project's phase three panel. This data was released in 2019 and is listed in our index files and available in ENA as study ERP114329.

Following release of the 2504 unrelated samples in the phase three panel, NYGC have, in addition, sequenced a further 698 samples from the collections created for the 1000 Genomes Project. This data is also at 30x coverage and was generated in the same way at NYGC. The set of 698 samples is composed of samples that are related to samples in the main 2504 panel, mainly completing trios (sets of parents and their children). The additional 698 have been added here and are available in ENA under study ERP120144. The data for the additional 698 related samples was released in 2020.

The total number of samples sequenced to 30x coverage by NYGC is 3202.
