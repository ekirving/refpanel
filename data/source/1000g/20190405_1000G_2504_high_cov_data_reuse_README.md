1000 Genomes 2504 phase 3 panel samples sequenced to high coverage
==================================================================

This policy refers to 30x Illumina NovaSeq sequencing of 2504 samples from the 1000 Genomes project phase 3 sample set. These data were generated at the New York Genome Center with funds provided by NHGRI Grant 3UM1HG008901-03S1. Please email service@nygenome.org with questions or interest in undertaking collaborative analysis of this dataset. All cell lines were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research and were consented for full public release of genomic data. Please see Coriell (https://www.coriell.org) for more information about specific cell lines. The following cell lines/DNA samples were obtained from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research: [NA06984, NA06985, NA06986, NA06989, NA06994, NA07000, NA07037, NA07048, NA07051, NA07056, NA07347, NA07357, NA10847, NA10851, NA11829, NA11830, NA11831, NA11832, NA11840, NA11843, NA11881, NA11892, NA11893, NA11894, NA11918, NA11919, NA11920, NA11930.
