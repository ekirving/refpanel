#Data Reuse policy - Gambian Genome Variation Project
 
This data was generated by the Gambian Genome Variation Project based at the MRC Unit in Fajara, The Gambia (http://www.mrc.gm), The Wellcome Sanger Institute (https://www.sanger.ac.uk), the Centre for Global Genomics and Health, University of Oxford (https://www.cggh.org/collaborations/mrc-unit-the-gambia) and the MalariaGEN Resource Centre (https://www.malariagen.net).
 
###Please respect Fort Lauderdale Principles
 
This data is freely shared in the expectation that they will be valuable for many researchers. Please observe the Fort Lauderdale principles when using this data. These principles entitle the data producers to make the first presentation and publish the first genome-wide analysis of the data. As of December 2019 the following publication provides a first description of the sample collection and use of the data as part of an imputation reference panel that includes the 1000G dataset and other African samples:
 
    *  Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network (2019), “New insights into malaria susceptibility from the genomes of 17,000 individuals from Africa, Asia, and Oceania”, Nat. Commun. 10:5732. (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13480-z).
 
The following is an earlier publication describing analysis of this data in a specific genomic region:
 
  *   Leffler et al. (2017), “Resistance to malaria through structural variation of red blood cell invasion receptors”, Science, 356:eaam6393 (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aam6393)

Please note: the above publications represent analysis of the data on GRCh37. The alignments, liftovers, etc. on GRCh38, in this data collection, are not part of the above publications and are the outputs of work at EMBL-EBI. We anticipate releasing details of the GRCh38 work in due course. For clarifiction on this and information on citing use of the GRCh38 based files, please contact info@1000genomes.org.
