The file links-to-read-alignments.txt contains links to read alignments (CRAM files) for the 929 samples included in the project. The data comes from three sources: 1) the Wellcome Sanger Institute, 2) the Simons Genome Diversity Project (SGDP), DOI: 10.1038/nature18964, 3) Meyer et al. 2012, DOI: 10.1126/science.1224344. While all of the raw data is also available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), more convenient and ready-to-use per-sample alignment files for the Sanger and SGDP data are made available by the IGSR (https://www.internationalgenome.org/), and these files are what is linked to here. For the Meyer et al. 2012 data, read alignments are made available here on this FTP server.

One note regarding the Wellcome Sanger Institute data hosted by the IGSR: a handful of samples were sequenced twice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, once with a PCR library and once with a PCR-free library. But to produce the VCF files hosted on this FTP server, only one of the libraries were used. In the processing performed by the IGSR to produce the CRAMs that are linked to from here, however, both libraries were used. For this handful of samples, the CRAMs therefore contain data from two libraries and they have double the sequencing coverage of most other CRAMs.
