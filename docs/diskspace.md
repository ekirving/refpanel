## Disk space requirements

The download footprint for the input data is:

| Folder                  | Size   |
|-------------------------|-------:|
| data/source/1000g/cram/ | 56 TB  |
| data/source/1000g/gVCF/ | 20 TB  |
| data/source/hgdp/cram/  | 36 TB  |
| data/source/sgdp/cram/  | 16 TB  |
| data/source/ggvp/cram/  |  5 TB  |
| data/source/appg/fastq/ | 13 TB  |

You will also need **a lot of additional space** to store the intermediate outputs from running the pipeline.
