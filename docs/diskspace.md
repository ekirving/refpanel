## Disk space requirements

The download footprint for the input data is:

| Folder                  | Size |
|-------------------------|------|
| data/source/1000g/gVCF/ | 20T  |
| data/source/hgdp/cram/  | ??T  |
| data/source/sgdp/cram/  | 16T  |
| data/source/ggvp/cram/  | 4.8T |

You will also need **a lot of additional space** to store the intermediate outputs from running the pipeline.
